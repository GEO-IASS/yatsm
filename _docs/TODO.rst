Model Parameters
================

The threshold on multitemporal noise screening
----------------------------------------------

Should customize this to handle more or less noise in the timeseries as
the amount screened can impact change detection

The time to refit the model
---------------------------

``if abs(self.X[self.here, 1] - self.trained_date) > self.ndays:``

Change to

``if abs(self.X[self.here, 1] - self.trained_date) > self.retrain_time:``

Should help: - Calculation time - Ability to find slow, gradual changes
that might be missed if the expectation (e.g., the regression model)
adapts too quickly

Timeseries Drivers
------------------

Delete them! Recode into a ``utils`` for grabbing a single pixel
