1. Save normal YATSM results to have prob and status attributes. These will start as 0.
-Easy, just do it in the ccdc.py (or my version of it)

2. For each pixel and for a certain date loop over prediction from most recent model. 
-I can just use the prediction from the prediction script - no need to fit new
model for now. 

3. if it's above threshold add 1 to both prob and status. for now dont worry about calculating prob.  
#i need to use np.linalg.norm on the scores like in the YATSM script to get
vector norm
#check if prob equals 0 or consecutive threshold


4. Resave the files with updated attributes and export a map.
