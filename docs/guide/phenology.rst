Long Term Mean Phenology
========================

This part of the guide is a work in progress and more information will be added.

The purpose of this module within YATSM is to provide long term mean phenological
characteristics of landscapes using an algorithm developed by Melaas *et al*
(2013) for each stable land cover segment identified by the CCDC portion of YATSM.
