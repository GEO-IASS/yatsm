Yet Another Time Series Model (YATSM)
=====================================

About
-----

The YATSM model is based off of tests for structural changes from the
econometrics literature including the MOSUM or CUMSUM
(Chu et al, Zeileis, and others) as implemented in a remote sensing context
by BFAST (Verbesselt, et al. 2012) and CCDC (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). This
effort is not intended as a direct port of either algorithm. The
"Yet Another..." within the "YATSM" name intends to refer to these two
algorithms without claiming 1 to 1 functionality of either.
