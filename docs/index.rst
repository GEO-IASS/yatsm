Yet Another Time Series Model (YATSM)
=====================================

About
-----

YATSM model based off of tests for structural changes from the econometrics
literature including the MOSUM or CUMSUM (Chu et al, Zeileis, and others) as
implemented in a remote sensing context by BFAST (Verbesselt, et al. 2012)
and CCDC (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014). This effort is not intended as a direct
port of either algorithm. The "YATSM" name intends to refer to these two
algorithms without claiming 1 to 1 functionality of either.
